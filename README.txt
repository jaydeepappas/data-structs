What's up - 

Code presented in the driver programs within each directory IS NOT MY CODE. If it is a file that is 
named "AssignmentX.cpp", that is the driver program and is written by professor Lee Koh at Texas State 
University. However, if the file has a different name and is a .cpp file, it is my code. For example, 
in the Assignment1 directory, the "Assignment01.cpp" file is not my code, but "IntSet.cpp" is my code.
