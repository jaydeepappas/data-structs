What's up - 

Code presented in the driver programs within each directory IS NOT MY CODE. If it is a file that is 
named "AssignmentX.cpp", that is the driver program and is written by professor Koh at Texas State 
University. However, if the file has a different name and is a .cpp file, it is my code. For example, 
in the Assignment1 directory, the "Assignment01.cpp" file is not mine, but "IntSet.cpp" is my code.

Enjoy checking out some sweet data structures. Koh is no joke, and if you're reading this you probably
have already figured that out. Good luck...
